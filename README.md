# README

## This is the README for the extension "ugly-like-me"

Just a random VS Code Extension Trying to be as ugly as possible.
I know, nothing is born ugly, everything takes it route and time to reach there. I believe soon this theme will reach its perks too!

Wanna help me turn it to the ugliest theme out there? SO UGLY THAT EVEN WE HATE TO APPLY IT!
Come raise your MRs at [Ugly Like Me](https://github.com/Ugly-Like-Me) and welcome to the UGLY SIDE!
